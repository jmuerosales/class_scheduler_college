Hard Constraints (Must Be Satisfied)
1. No Teacher Conflicts – A teacher cannot be scheduled to teach multiple subjects at the same time.
2. No Room Conflicts – A room can only have one class at a time.
3. No Student Group Conflicts – A student group can only attend one subject at a time.
4. Correct Room Type – Laboratory subjects must be assigned to laboratory rooms. Lecture subjects can be in any room.
5. Part-Time Teacher Restriction – Part-time teachers can only teach on Saturdays.
6. School Hours Restriction – Classes must be scheduled between 8:00 AM and 5:00 PM.
7. Lunch Break Restriction – No classes between 12:00 PM and 1:00 PM.
8. Course-Year Level Match – A student group must take only subjects that match their course and year level.
9. Teacher Subject Specialization – Teachers can only teach subjects they are assigned to.
10. Required Weekly Lecture Hours – Each subject has a required number of lecture hours per week, which must be scheduled.
11. Continuous Lesson Slots – Subjects requiring multiple hours should have continuous time slots where possible.
12. All Subjects Must Be Scheduled – If a subject cannot be scheduled due to constraints, it is flagged as "unassigned" and reported.

Soft Constraints (Preferable but Can Be Violated)
1. Balanced Schedule Distribution – Avoid scheduling all hours of a subject on the same day. Spread subjects across multiple days where possible.
2. Evenly Distribute Classes Across Days – Prioritize underutilized days (e.g., Tuesday and Wednesday) over heavily scheduled ones (e.g., Monday and Friday).
3. Teacher Room Stability – Teachers prefer to teach in the same room whenever possible.
4. Teacher Time Efficiency – Teachers prefer sequential lessons with minimal gaps between their classes.
5. Student Group Subject Variety – Avoid scheduling the same subject multiple times in a row to increase variety in student learning.
6. Minimize Teacher Gaps – Reduce the number of free periods between a teacher’s lessons to optimize their schedule.
